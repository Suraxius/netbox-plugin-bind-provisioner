## 1.0.7 - 2026-03-02
README Change - Moving private keys to global scope since Bind 9.20 view scoped keys have become unreliable and sometimes wouldnt match.

## 1.0.8 - 2026-03-12
- Change License to MIT to match the netbox-plugin-dns License. This project rests on the netbox-plugin-dns so a matching
  license makes more sense.
- Renaming Project from Netbox Plugin Bind Provisioner to Netbox DNS Bridge as new code will be contributed that allows
  data to flow in both directions (Dynamic Updates), not just out of Netbox DNS.

## 1.5.0 - 2026-04-08
- Change to versioning scheme - Now matches the major and minor version number to the one of netbox-plugin-dns. Only the minor sub version
  will be used to track incremental changes to this plugin.
